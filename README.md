# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. Each solution is implemented in a Python Jupyter Notebook.

## Structure

- Each day's challenge input is expected in a separate directory named after the day number (e.g., `1`, `2`, etc.).
- The input for each day's challenge is expected to be in a file named `input.txt` within the corresponding day's directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory of the day you want to work on (e.g., `1`).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook for that day.
3. Ensure that the `input.txt` file is present in the directory.
4. Run the notebook to see the solution for that day's challenge.

Happy coding!
